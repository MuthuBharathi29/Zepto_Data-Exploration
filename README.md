# Zepto_Data-Exploration
## Project Overview

This project analyzes Zeptoâ€™s product dataset using SQL. The goal is to perform data exploration, cleaning, and business insights generation from product-level information such as MRP, discounts, stock availability, and weights.

The analysis helps answer key business questions like:

1.Which products offer the best discounts?

2.Which categories drive the highest revenue?

3.What products are out of stock despite being high in demand?

4.How to classify inventory into low, medium, and bulk categories?
