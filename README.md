# Zepto_Data-Exploration
## Project Overview

This project analyzes Zeptoâ€™s product dataset using SQL. The goal is to perform data exploration, cleaning, and business insights generation from product-level information such as MRP, discounts, stock availability, and weights.

The analysis helps answer key business questions like:

1.Which products offer the best discounts?
2.Which categories drive the highest revenue?
3.What products are out of stock despite being high in demand?
